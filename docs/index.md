# Introduction

---

The amount of notifications that anti-CSAM organizations receive grows exponentially 
every year. As a result, checking, handling and documenting all these reports can 
easily overwhelm whole teams.

Our Sexual Child Abuse Reporting Tool (SCARt) automates and simplifies CSAM-handling 
and reporting processes. Through its easy-to-use interface, CSAM can quickly be 
identified and follow-up actions can be initiated at the touch of a button. A wide 
range of features help teams stay organized thanks to monitoring and automatic 
(re)notification.

#### About SCARt

SCARt is developed and maintained by the AbuseIO Foundation. In 2013, this Dutch 
non-profit organization began releasing free-to-use software and tools to help detect, 
manage and resolve internet abuse. AbuseIO developed SCARt initially for the Dutch 
CSAM Hotline ("Offlimits") simplify their abuse report handling. 

Created together with the Dutch Expertise Centre for Online Child Sexual Abuse and 
our technology partners, S3group, the software has drastically reduced abuse report 
handling times since its implementation in 2019. Over time, SCARtâ€™s functionality 
has increased, and the software is now ready for use by other CSAM Hotlines and 
similar organizations around the world. As of today, hotlines in Denmark, Sweden, 
Romania, and Finland are using SCARt.

#### Funded

SCARt is funded through grants, donations and the hard work of the open source 
community. Together, we can help keep children safe around the world.
